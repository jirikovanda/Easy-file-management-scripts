## Index of Scripts

- **deduplicate_keep_newest_in_place/**  
  A Python script that recursively scans a given folder, finds files with identical content, and keeps only the most recent copy of each file in its original location.  
  All other duplicates are moved into a `Duplik√°ty/` folder created at the root of the scanned folder.

More scripts will be added over time. Each script is self-contained and includes its own README with details on installation and usage.
